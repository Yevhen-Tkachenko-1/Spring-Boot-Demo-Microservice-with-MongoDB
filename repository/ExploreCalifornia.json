Take a tranquil walk to the coastal waterfall at Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Par or hike to the Married Redwoods. If you're prepared for a more strenuous climb, try Ollason's Peak in Toro Park.

Along the way, you'll bear witness to the classic monuments of Yosemite, such as Vernal Falls, Nevada Falls, Half Dome, Cathedral Peak, Tuolumne Meadows and Mt. Lyell. At Nevada Falls, the trail becomes narrow and from then on, you'll be privy to a \"secret\" Yosemite, including a rarely seen face of Half Dome. John Muir Trail tickets are required- and hard to come by- but Explore California has you covered. We'll also provide a checklist so that you come prepared with the right equipment and a seasoned guide for your tour.",
